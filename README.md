R code to reproduce the Motivating Example and Performance Evaluation detailed in 'Bayesian sample size determination using robust commensurate priors with interpretable discrepancy weights'.

The file 'motivating_example.R' is for reproducing the results presented in the Motivating Example (Section 4) using the proposed Bayesian sample size formula and linearization technique.

The file 'samplesizes_and_priors_simstudy.R' is for calculating the sample sizes and priors used in the Performance Evaluation (Section 5) for Configurations 1-4 of historical data.

The file 'analysis_simstudy.R' is for simulating clinical trial datasets with sample sizes according to 'samplesizes_and_priors_simstudy.R' and implementing the subsequent Bayesian analysis.
